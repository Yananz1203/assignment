            <p>Dedicated to the exploration of new Scales of Engagement, the School aspires to inspire and to foster an open and generous intellectual environment in which each one of us is invited to think, design, and practice new forms of collectivity and collaboration, new experiences and material realities, and new productive intersections and exchanges between the disciplines and practices of the built environment—all with the aim to generate a more equitable, sustainable, and creative future.</p>
